docker-images
+++++++++++++

**Note: These images are deprecated and unlikely to get updatd in the future**

Dockerfiles for some docker images I'm using: 

* gentoo-hardened: Contains a stage3 hardened without multilib Gentoo system. (No portage tree). 
* gentoo-pgsql-9.4: Contains ready to use PostgreSQL server based on gentoo-hardened. 

I tried to make the images as small as possible, but they are still 740MB and 820MB.
